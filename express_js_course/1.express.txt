server logic is complex
to parse an incoming request:
to extract an incoming body:manuallu start data event, end event and thats all only for the string data type/data so for other types such as files or some other we might need to write even more larger code

focus on our core logic
use framework for heavy lifting: helper funcitons, tools, rules help to build our application
 
MIDDLEWARE: multiple piece of request

request ---> middleware:(req,res,next){---next()} ---> middleware:(req,res,next){---res.send()} ---> response
